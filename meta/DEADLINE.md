## Part 1: App Description
My app provides an image of an outfit based on the weather of a city the user enters.
The user types in any city in the textfield, and they get a picture of an outfit
based on the current weather. The first API I use is a weather API (https://api-ninjas.com/api/weather) to get the weather
of the city. The second API I use is an image search API (https://unsplash.com/developers) that gets an image of
an outfit based on the weather conditions.

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I got more comfortable working with APIs. I learned how easy and accesible APIs are and how many there are. The possibilies are really endless!

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I could start over, I would use another weather API so that I include more conditions like rain to get more variety in outfits.
